# Mole's Test Environment

This provides a small envorinment where `mole` functions can be tested and
debugged.

Once created, the test environment will provide a container running a ssh
server and another container running two (2) http servers, so ssh tunnels can
be created using `mole`.

In addition to that, the test environment provides the infrastructure to
analyze the traffic going through the ssh traffic.

## Required Software

You will need the following software installed on your computer to build this
test environment:

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
* ssh
* ssh-keygen
* [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html) (optional)

## Managing the Environment

### Setup

```sh
$ make test-env
```

This builds two docker containers: `mole_ssh` and `mole_http` with a local
network (192.168.33.0/24) that connects them.

`mole_ssh` runs a ssh server listening on port `22`.
This port is published on the local computer using port `22122`, so ssh
connections can be made using address `127.0.0.1:22122`.
All ssh connection to `mole_ssh` should be done using the user `mole` and the
key file located on `test-env/key`
The ssh server is configured to end any connections that is idle for three (3)
or more seconds.

`mole_http` runs two http servers listening on port `80` and `8080`, so clients
would be able to access the using the following urls: `http://192.168.33.11:80/`
and `http://192.168.33.11:8080/`

### Teardown

```sh
$ make rm-test-env
```

This will destroy both of the containers that was built by running
`make test-env`: `mole_ssh` and `mole_http`.

The ssh authentication key files, `test-env/key` and `test-env/key,pub` will
**not** be deleted.

## How to use the test environment and mole together

```sh
$ make test-env
<lots of output messages here>
$ mole -insecure -local :21112 -local :21113 -remote 192.168.33.11:80 -remote 192.168.33.11:8080 -server mole@127.0.0.1:22122 -key test-env/ssh-server/keys/key -keep-alive-interval 2s
INFO[0000] tunnel is ready                               local="127.0.0.1:21113" remote="192.168.33.11:8080"
INFO[0000] tunnel is ready                               local="127.0.0.1:21112" remote="192.168.33.11:80"
$ curl 127.0.0.1:21112
:)
$ curl 127.0.0.1:21113
:)
```

NOTE: If you're wondering about the smile face, that is the response from both 
http servers.

## How to manage the ssh server instance

```sh
$ docker exec -ti mole_ssh supervisorctl <stop|start|restart> sshd
```

## Packet Analisys

If you need to analyze the traffic going through the tunnel, the test
environment provide a handy way to sniff all traffic following the steps below:

```sh
$ make test-env
<lots of output messages here>
$ bash test-env/sniff
tcpdump: listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
```

Wireshark will open and should show all traffic passing through the tunnel.
