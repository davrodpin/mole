/*
LockedBuffer is a structure that holds secure values.

The protected memory itself can be accessed with the Buffer() method. The various states can be accessed with the IsDestroyed() and IsMutable() methods, both of which are pretty self-explanatory.

The number of LockedBuffers that you are able to create is limited by how much memory your system kernel allows each process to mlock/VirtualLock. Therefore you should call Destroy on LockedBuffers that you no longer need, or simply defer a Destroy call after creating a new LockedBuffer.

The entire memguard API handles and passes around pointers to LockedBuffers, and so, for both security and convenience, you should refrain from dereferencing a LockedBuffer.

If an API function that needs to edit a LockedBuffer is given one that is immutable, the call will return an ErrImmutable. Similarly, if a function is given a LockedBuffer that has been destroyed, the call will return an ErrDestroyed.
